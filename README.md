We	want	to	change	the	shape	(number	of	rows	and	columns)	of	an	array	without	changing	the	element  values, The solution is 	NumPy’s	reshape, reshape	allows	us	to	restructure	an	array	so	that	we	maintain	the	same	data	but	it	is	organized	as	a
different	number	of	rows	and	columns.	The	only	requirement	is	that	the	shape	of	the	original	and	new matrix	contain	the	same	number	of	elements	(i.e.,	the	same	size).	We	can	see	the	size	of	a	matrix	using
 size, One	useful	argument	in	reshape	is	-1,	which	effectively	means	“as	many	as	needed,”	so	reshape(1,-1)	means	one	row	and	as	many	columns	as	needed,Finally,	if	we	provide	one	integer,	reshape	will	return	a	1D	array	of	that	length:
