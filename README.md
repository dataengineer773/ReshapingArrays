We	want	to	change	the	shape	(number	of	rows	and	columns)	of	an	array	without	changing	the	element  values, The solution is 	NumPyâ€™s	reshape, reshape	allows	us	to	restructure	an	array	so	that	we	maintain	the	same	data	but	it	is	organized	as	a
different	number	of	rows	and	columns.	The	only	requirement	is	that	the	shape	of	the	original	and	new matrix	contain	the	same	number	of	elements	(i.e.,	the	same	size).	We	can	see	the	size	of	a	matrix	using
 size.
